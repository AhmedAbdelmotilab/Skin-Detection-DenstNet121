Skin diseases have been increasing among men and women worldwide for many decades [1].
The skin, the body's biggest organ, serves as an important barrier. The skin's principal functions are 
to protect the body from harmful chemicals in the environment and to prevent the body's various 
nutrients from leaking out. Many elements influence skin health in human productive life, including 
UV rays, smoking, drinking, exercise, infections, and the employment environment. Skin problems 
are currently among the most common ailments afflicting people. A third to seventy percent of the 
population is classified as high-risk. Every year, 5.4 million new cases of skin cancer are reported in 
the United States, according to the British Skin Foundation Report from 2018 [2]. One in every five 
Americans  will  be diagnosed  with  cutaneous  cancer  during  their  lifetime.  Skin  disorders 
significantly negatively impact people's daily lives, interpersonal interactions, internal organs, and 
even survival. This illness, as a mental ailment, has the potential to induce solitude, despair, and 
even suicide. As a result, skin disease has emerged as one of the most pressing issues in medicine. 
According to recent research [3], skin problems impact millions of individuals globally and cause 
significant illnesses. Skin disease prevalence has progressively increased throughout the years, with 
some illnesses being more widespread than others.
